First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

### Pull Requests

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer merge it for you.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
